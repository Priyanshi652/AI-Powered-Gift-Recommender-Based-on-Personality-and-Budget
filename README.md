# AI-Powered-Gift-Recommender-Based-on-Personality-and-Budget


A personalized gift suggestion system using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** based on the recipient's **personality** and **budget**. This project aims to solve a common real-world problem: "What should I gift someone that suits them and fits my budget?"

## üß© Demo

Try the app locally using Streamlit:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Choosing a thoughtful gift is difficult ‚Äî especially when you're unsure about someone's preferences or your budget is limited. Most gifting platforms offer generic suggestions, not personalized ones. The aim is to help users find suitable gifts based on the **recipient's personality** and their **budget** using AI.

---

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

This project offers a smart and lightweight web app that:

* Takes **personality traits** and **budget** as inputs
* Uses an ML model to **predict the most suitable gift category**
* Displays a list of recommended gifts under that category and budget
* (Optional) Supports voice input (removed in this version)

---

## üéØ Features

* Personality-based classification of gifts
* Budget filtering
* ML-powered gift category prediction (Random Forest Classifier)
* Responsive web app using Streamlit
* Easily expandable product dataset

## ü§ñ Model Details

* **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
* **Input Features**: Encoded `personality_type`, `budget`
* **Target**: Gift category (multi-class)
* **Training**: Performed on a small but diverse labeled dataset
* **Serialization**: Model and encoders stored using `joblib`

---

## üìä Results

* ML model accurately predicts gift categories based on limited inputs
* Streamlit app displays correct gift recommendations for multiple test cases
* Fast response and easy to use, even on low-end systems

---

## üîÆ Future Scope

* Use NLP embeddings to understand broader personality descriptions
* Export gift recommendations to PDF or send via email
* Integrate live pricing/product APIs from Flipkart, Amazon
* Save user profiles for more intelligent suggestions over time
* Build mobile app version using React Native or Flutter
